# Mario-Game-V1
This is a simple Mario-esque game that allows you to jump from block to block, jump underneath the questionmark blocks to attain coins, and create new blocks by clicking and dragging with the mouse.

The level presented is a very short example with multiple blocks to jump on and coins to gather.

To play start by downloading the sourcefiles and the batch file. Run the batch file to compile and begin running the program.
Use the left and right arrow keys to move left and right respectively, and the space bar to jump.
